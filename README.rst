**Goal:** To create a website for viewing, searching, & browsing the wheels on
PyPI by their metadata (including entry points, dependency links, ``WHEEL``
data, etc.) in more detail than is shown on PyPI itself.

This is the code for that website.  It's still a work in progress.

Not Supported
=============
- PyPI releases that don't distribute wheels
- ill-formed wheels
- large wheels
