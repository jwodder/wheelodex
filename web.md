- The main page should provide a download of a database export that is rebuilt
  daily.

- Items displayed on the page for a given wheel:
    - metadata
        - links to dependencies
    - links to reverse dependencies (specifically, those projects whose
      highest-numbered non-prerelease versions depend upon some version of the
      project to which the wheel belongs, regardless of platform etc.
      compatibility)
    - etc.
