    # Various statistics about irregularities etc. that cannot be (easily)
    # derived from the other fields:
    # - whether signed
    # - whether tags (and name & version?) in filename match those in WHEEL
    # - whether keywords are space- or comma-separated
    # - whether Description is a header field or the body
    # - whether the README renders properly
    # - whether RECORD is accurate? (cf. distlib's Wheel.verify())
